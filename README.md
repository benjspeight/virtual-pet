### Interacting with Your Pet
#### growUp()
This function makes the pet grow one year older, and increases its hunger and decreases its fitness.

#### walk()
This function takes the pet for a walk, increasing its fitness by 4 (up to a maximum of 10).

#### feed()
This function feeds the pet, decreasing its hunger by 3 (down to a minimum of 0).

#### checkUp()
This function checks the pet's fitness and hunger levels, and logs a message depending on its needs. If the pet's fitness is below 3 and its hunger is above 5, it needs a walk and is hungry. If its fitness is above 3 and its hunger is below 5, it feels great. If its fitness is below 3 and its hunger is below 5, it needs a walk. If its fitness is above 3 and its hunger is above 5, it is hungry.
